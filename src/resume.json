  "about": "I'm a BS/MS Computer Science student at UIUC (Dean’s List, James Scholar) passionate about high-performance systems, low-latency infrastructure, and machine learning. I’ve interned at Sony/PlayStation building microservices, ML pipelines, and streaming analysis tools, and currently work at SquareKettle designing low-latency trading systems and market-making strategies. My projects span protocol-level encoders, compression engines, and real-time LLM tools. I placed in the top 3% globally (3rd in Korea) in IMC Prosperity and was a finalist in Akuna Capital's Options 201 program."
